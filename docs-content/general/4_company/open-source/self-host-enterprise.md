## Our Enterprise Self-hosted Deployment

If you're interested in using highlight.io, but are worried about the cost, privacy or scaling concerns of using a hosted service, we've got you covered. We offer a self-hosted enterprise deployment of our open-source backend, which you can deploy to your own infrastructure.

Below, we detail how this works, what pricing looks like, and how to get started.

## How it works

Highlight.io's enterprise self-hosted deployment is a fully managed deployment of our open-source backend. We provide a docker image that you can deploy to your own infrastructure, along with a set of storage solutions. This differs from our [hobby deployment](self-host-hobby.md), which only works for smaller scale applications.

In terms of level of management, we offer the option to support a cloudprem or onprem approach, depending on your needs.

## Licensing

The core codebase of our github repo is licensed under Apache 2.0. This means that you can use the codebase for free, and modify it as you see fit. However, our enterprise deployment, which supports multi-node deployments, is licensed under a commercial license. This means that you can't modify the codebase, and you can't use it for free. This part of the codebase can be found under `/ee` in our github repo.

## Getting started

To get started with seeing if highlight.io is a good fit, we recommend taking a look at our [hobby deployment](self-host-hobby.md) or even trying out our solution on the [hobby deployment](./self-host-hobby.md).

After you've evaluated, please reach out to us over email at [sales@highlight.io](mailto:sales@highlight.io) or in our discord community to inquire about next steps.

## Pricing

Pricing for our self-hosted enterprise deployment starts at $3k / month. Contact us at sales@highlight.io, or message us [on discord](https://community.highlight.io) to get in touch.
